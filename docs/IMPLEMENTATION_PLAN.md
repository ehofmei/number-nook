# Implementation Plan

## Purpose

This plan translates the product research into a sequence of small, verifiable engineering milestones. It prioritizes a complete vertical slice and the testing foundation before broad feature coverage or final artwork.

## Delivery principles

1. Build features as complete slices through domain logic, interface, persistence, and tests.
2. Keep mathematical and economic logic independent of React and browser APIs.
3. Make randomness, time, storage, and content injectable and deterministic.
4. Establish one-command verification before the application becomes large.
5. Validate the interaction loop with placeholder content before producing the full collectible set.
6. Keep every milestone deployable; unfinished later features should not destabilize the completed core.
7. Prefer explicit state models and versioned data over convenient implicit behavior.

## Definition of the first vertical slice

The first vertical slice proves one complete player journey:

1. Launch the app with no save.
2. Enter a local display name.
3. Choose one of three placeholder starter cats.
4. Configure an Easy, ten-question addition game.
5. Play with four answer choices, a subtle count-up timer, and a short feedback beat.
6. Complete the round and see accuracy, elapsed time, a simple improvement message, score, and Paw Coins.
7. Spend coins on the duplicate-protected Companion Capsule.
8. Reveal a collectible and view it in the unified gallery.
9. Equip the collectible and see it on the home screen.
10. Reload the app and confirm that identity, settings, progress, currency, ownership, and equipped state persist.

This is intentionally narrower than the eventual MVP. It validates almost every important architectural seam without requiring four operations, final adaptive practice, a balanced economy, or production artwork.

## Architecture established before feature work

### Dependency boundaries

The application should depend inward:

```text
React UI
  -> application/session services
    -> domain modules

browser adapters
  -> domain interfaces

domain modules
  -X-> React, DOM, localStorage, Date, Math.random
```

Domain code must not directly import React, DOM APIs, `localStorage`, `Date.now()`, or `Math.random()`.

### Core interfaces

The exact naming can change, but these capabilities should be explicit:

```ts
interface RandomSource {
  next(): number;
  integer(minInclusive: number, maxInclusive: number): number;
  shuffle<T>(values: readonly T[]): T[];
}

interface Clock {
  now(): number;
  today(): string;
}

interface SaveRepository {
  load(): Promise<SaveData | null>;
  save(data: SaveData): Promise<void>;
  export(data: SaveData): Promise<string>;
  parseImport(serialized: string): Promise<SaveData>;
}

interface CollectibleCatalog {
  get(id: CollectibleId): CollectibleDefinition | undefined;
  list(): readonly CollectibleDefinition[];
  version(): string;
}
```

Production adapters provide seeded or cryptographically unnecessary normal randomness, the system clock, `localStorage`, and repository content. Tests provide deterministic implementations.

### Explicit application states

At minimum, model navigation and game lifecycle explicitly.

```text
onboarding
home
setup
playing.ready
playing.answering
playing.feedback
results
capsule.reveal
gallery
settings
```

The reducer or state machine must reject invalid transitions, including:

- Answering twice during feedback.
- Starting a second timer.
- Opening a capsule without sufficient currency.
- Equipping an unowned collectible.
- Completing a session more than once.

### Stable identifiers

- Operation IDs are code-stable values such as `addition`.
- Skill IDs are stable facts such as `addition:7+6` after commutative normalization rules are defined.
- Collectibles use `pack-id:item-id`.
- Personal-best keys are generated from a canonical settings fingerprint.
- Released identifiers are never reused for different meanings.

## Proposed repository structure

```text
src/
  app/
    App.tsx
    routes.ts
    state.ts
  domain/
    game/
    math/
    scoring/
    rewards/
    progress/
  adapters/
    browserClock.ts
    localStorageSaveRepository.ts
    randomSource.ts
  content/
    schema.ts
    catalog.ts
    packs/
  features/
    onboarding/
    setup/
    play/
    results/
    capsule/
    gallery/
    settings/
  components/
  styles/
  dev/
    StateGallery.tsx
  main.tsx
tests/
  fixtures/
  properties/
  e2e/
  visual/
scripts/
  validate-content.ts
```

Folders should be introduced only when needed; this is a target shape, not a requirement to create empty directories.

- A rapid double tap cannot answer two questions.
- The first selected answer is the scored answer.
- The feedback state lasts a controlled deterministic interval.
- The timer excludes paused time when pause is introduced.
- Correctness is never conveyed through color alone.
- The flow works at target phone and tablet viewports without horizontal scrolling.
- All three starters are visible together at the target phone width, and entering the Nook requires an explicit starter selection.
- First-run language does not imply that a returning-player history already exists.
- Critical states pass automated accessibility scans and manual keyboard review.

- Reload recovery.

### Acceptance criteria

- Reloading at every safe navigation point preserves committed progress.
- Interrupted writes do not produce a partially valid save.
- A capsule cannot be opened without sufficient currency.
- Every successful capsule transaction is atomic: currency is spent exactly once and ownership is granted exactly once.
- Owned and equipped IDs resolve against the bundled catalog.
- New catalog items appear as unowned without save migration.
- Removed or unknown legacy IDs do not crash the application.

## Milestone 4: Production PWA slice

### Deliverables

- Service worker and offline precache.
- Safe update-available prompt.
- Deferred update activation during active play and reward reveals.
- App icons and install metadata.
- Offline production-preview tests.
- GitHub Pages workflow.
- ~~JSON export/import UI.~~ Complete backup download/share and confirmed restore are available on existing and brand-new devices.
- Initial install and real-device checklists.

### Acceptance criteria

- After one online load, the production app launches and completes a game offline.
- Deploying a new catalog version preserves the save and exposes new unowned content after update.
- An update never reloads an active session.
- Export, reset, import, and reload restore the same meaningful progress.
- The GitHub Pages build works under the repository subpath.
- Physical iPhone and iPad smoke checks are documented and completed before calling the slice done.

## Expansion after the vertical slice

Add one independently verified slice at a time:

1. ~~Subtraction, including nonnegative constraints and borrow-aware difficulty.~~ Completed in ruleset version 4.
2. ~~Multiplication with curated table presets and constrained session composition.~~ Completed in ruleset version 3.
3. ~~Division generated from divisor and quotient with explicit low-challenge limits.~~ Completed in ruleset version 3.
4. ~~Mixed operations with balanced short-session coverage.~~ Completed.
5. Practice mode retry and hint representations.
6. Time Rush and Endless.
7. Per-skill mastery and guided-random weighting.
8. ~~Question-level round review and bounded local play history.~~ Completed with a 30-round detailed window and lifetime aggregates. A richer progress dashboard remains future work.
9. Weekly three-day goal and daily completion bonus.
10. Direct-purchase shop and tuned rarity economy.
11. Improvement Duel after at least five comparable sessions.
12. Final collectible art and expanded repository packs.
13. ~~Companion personality dialogue, reusable CSS motion/motif profiles, and a development Companion Lab.~~ Completed across Home, Setup, Results, idle Capsule, equip confirmation, and Play History, with stable event-based selection and browser/visual coverage.
14. Optional speech and sound. The synthesized contextual-effects pass, opt-in menu/results music, independent device preferences, player-facing audio Settings, and development Sound/Music Labs are complete. After broad style testing exposed disconnected foreground notes, pad-only, blended-legato, and flowing-pattern experiments identified Starlight Stream as the default while retaining all four tracks as player choices. Further refinement, longer arrangements, and spoken problems remain future work.

Each operation must ship with its generator invariants, distractor rules, difficulty tests, UI behavior, progress aggregation, and end-to-end coverage. “Adding the operation” is not complete when only the equation generator exists.

## Content-update workflow

When adding a companion or Special Guest:

1. Choose a permanent stable ID.
2. Add the catalog definition, art, thumbnail, alt text, rarity, capsule weight, shop price, and personality.
3. Run content validation and asset-size checks.
4. Confirm gallery card, silhouette, shop preview, capsule reveal, equipped state, and narrow-layout rendering in the state gallery.
5. Run the capsule statistical tests with the expanded pool.
6. Decide whether to bundle ordinary companions with a new Special Guest so rarity weighting remains meaningful for established players.
7. Build and test the update path using an older save fixture.
8. Deploy only after verification passes.

Catalog version 2.2 separates collection, species, rarity, and Special Guest status while preserving stable existing IDs. The complete Nook Neighbors roster and Button Bunny now have per-companion themes and both Classic/Sticker assets; the remembered art-style preference and setup, game-header, results, home-shortcut, and collection-spotlight placements are implemented. Companion Capsule is the species-neutral reward name. Content validation, production caching, and phone/tablet regression coverage protect the expansion path. The complete decision is recorded in [Companion Identity, Themes, and Presence](./COMPANION_SYSTEM.md).

## Completion policy

A feature is complete only when:

- Behavior and edge cases are defined.
- Domain logic is tested.
- Component states are represented in the state gallery where visual.
- Critical user behavior has an end-to-end test.
- Accessibility implications are checked.
- Save compatibility is considered.
- Phone and tablet layouts are inspected.
- Documentation is updated when the feature changes a durable decision.

## First implementation decision point

The next authorized build task should be Milestone 0 followed by Milestone 1. The first application UI should not be built until deterministic randomness, clocks, storage contracts, test runners, and the content schema exist.
